Waiter Tip Prediction and Analysis

Description:
This project focuses on predicting waiter tips based on various factors. It explores data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between input features and tip amounts. The project is implemented in Python and employs a variety of regression models and evaluation metrics.

Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
Application of multiple regression models, including:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
Technologies and Tools
The following libraries and frameworks are used:

Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning:
scikit-learn
tensorflow
eli5 (Permutation Importance)
Model Evaluation: mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score


Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/waiter-tip-prediction.git
        cd waiter-tip-prediction
2. Install the required dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

Future Improvements

Include more advanced models like XGBoost or CatBoost for enhanced predictions.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
